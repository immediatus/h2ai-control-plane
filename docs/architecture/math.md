# H2AI Math Apparatus

The math underlying H2AI Control Plane is built around a single observation: the reliability gain from running N LLM adapters in parallel depends on **two independent diversity signals**, not one. The system measures and uses both:

- **Hamming Common Ground (CG)** — pairwise constraint-profile agreement. Drives the USL coordination cost `β_eff` and the ensemble ceiling `N_max`.
- **Cosine N_eff** — eigenvalue participation ratio of the embedding cosine kernel. Drives the pool-diversity guard, the MAPE-K failure-mode classifier, and the post-merge `EpistemicYield` event.

This document defines every formula the runtime uses, where it lives in the codebase, and what it does and does not actually measure.

---

## 1. Bivariate Common Ground

### 1.1 Hamming CG (constraint profile)

`CgMode::ConstraintProfile` (default). For each pair of adapters (i, j), CG(i, j) is the mean Hamming similarity between their binary constraint-satisfaction vectors over the calibration corpus:

```
CG(i, j) = 1 − HammingDistance(profile_i, profile_j) / |corpus|
CG_mean  = mean over all pairs (i, j) with i < j
```

Source: `crates/h2ai-autonomic/src/calibration.rs`. Falls back to `cfg.calibration_cg_fallback` when no corpus is available.

### 1.2 Cosine N_eff (embedding kernel)

`CgMode::EmbeddingCosine`. For each pair, compute `cos(embed_i, embed_j)` from the calibration prompts. The N×N cosine matrix C is normalised K = C / N so that `trace(K) = 1` and the eigenvalues sum to 1. Then:

```
N_eff = (Σ λ_i)² / Σ λ_i²
```

This is the participation ratio from portfolio theory (Choueifaty & Coignard 2008). At full independence (K = I/N) it returns N; at full correlation (rank-1 K) it returns 1.

Source: `crates/h2ai-types/src/sizing.rs::EigenCalibration::from_cosine_matrix` and `crates/h2ai-autonomic/src/epistemic.rs::compute_n_eff_cosine`.

### 1.3 Why both

Hamming CG measures *behavioural* agreement on the constraint corpus. Cosine N_eff measures *semantic* independence at the level of token sequences. They disagree predictably:

- Two adapters can share constraint profiles by accident (high CG_mean) while producing semantically distinct text (high N_eff). Coordination is cheap but exploration is real.
- Two adapters can produce semantically identical hallucinations (low N_eff) while disagreeing on which constraints they violated (low CG_mean). The committee is degenerate even though it looks decorrelated.

Both signals must be tracked. The runtime uses Hamming CG for the USL coordination cost (because it correlates with merge effort) and cosine N_eff for diversity gating (because it correlates with epistemic independence).

---

## 2. USL — Universal Scalability Law

Source: Gunther 1993. Implemented in `crates/h2ai-types/src/sizing.rs::CoherencyCoefficients`.

```
X(N) = N / (1 + α(N − 1) + β·N(N − 1))
```

- `α` — contention (serial-fraction) coefficient, fitted by `usl_fit` in `crates/h2ai-autonomic/src/calibration.rs`.
- `β`  — coherency-drag coefficient.

The runtime uses an effective β driven by Hamming CG:

```
β_eff = β₀ × (1 − CG_mean)        bounded at β₀ when CG_mean = 0
```

> **Note (conditional derivation):** `β_eff = β₀ × (1 − CG_mean)` has a first-principles derivation
> under one key assumption: constraint conflict resolution cost is linear in conflict count. If
> the expected conflict rate between any two adapters is `(1 − CG_mean)` (fraction of constraints
> where they disagree), and resolution cost per conflict is proportional to β₀, then:
> `β_eff ∝ β₀ × (1 − CG_mean)`. The linear form follows directly.
>
> The derivation breaks if conflict resolution is super-linear (e.g. due to "Lost in the Middle"

> **Calibration note:** the current calibration measures `β₀` from API round-trip latency,

> bucket). When ≥`min_samples_for_override` production tasks have accumulated, `beta_quality`
> overrides the latency-based proxy in N_max computation.

Setting `dX/dN = 0` gives the ensemble cost ceiling:

```
N_max = round(√((1 − α) / β_eff))
```

> **N_max is a cost ceiling, not a quality target.** USL was derived for CPU/network throughput;
> no published work validates USL N_max as a quality ceiling for LLM ensembles. The quality
> target is `n_it_optimal` (§5.1). The planning logic uses `min(n_it_optimal, N_max)`.

A one-σ confidence interval `(n_max_lo, n_max_hi)` is propagated from the **sample** CG variance
(`cg_std_dev` uses Bessel-corrected variance `/ (n−1)`): `n_at_cg(CG_mean ± cg_std_dev)`.

### 2.1 Two layers of cost — orchestration vs. synthesis

A common misreading of the USL model is: "the system uses a DAG for orchestration, so coordination is O(N), and therefore β does not apply." This conflates two separate costs that operate at different layers.

**Orchestration layer — O(N):** Selecting topology (HierarchicalTree vs. Ensemble), routing proposals through a DAG, and dispatching subtasks all scale at most linearly in N. The `HierarchicalTree` topology is selected precisely when N > N_max to reduce *orchestration* coordination from O(N²) to O(N).

**Synthesis layer — O(N²):** After proposals arrive, the system must reconcile them. Two O(N²) costs occur here regardless of the orchestration topology:
1. **CG computation** — `CG_mean` is the mean over all `N×(N−1)/2` pairwise Hamming similarities across surviving proposals. This is measured, not approximated.
2. **Synthesis context reconciliation** — the synthesis LLM receives all N surviving proposals concatenated. Identifying which proposals contradict which constraints across N proposals is a pairwise comparison problem. The "Lost in the Middle" attention degradation (Liu et al. 2023) is also super-linear: retrieval quality for any single proposal decays as the total context grows, so the effective O(N²) term is in proposal-pair incompatibility detection, not just sequential token processing.

β_eff is fitted from merge-phase timing, which captures both components. The orchestration topology does not reduce β — it reduces α.

### 2.3 Context-aware N_max

Coordination cost has two physical components: conflict reconciliation (the merge step, reduced by CG) and positional attention degradation in the synthesis context window ("Lost in the Middle", Liu et al. 2023). The latter is orthogonal to CG and is modelled by amplifying β with the context-fill fraction:

```
fill(N)       = min(1, N × proposal_tokens / max_tokens)
β_ctx(N)      = β_eff × (1 + γ × fill(N))
N_max_ctx     = solve N = √((1 − α) / β_ctx(N))   (iterative; ≤ 5 iterations)
```

`γ` is the attention-sensitivity coefficient.

### 2.4 Temporal decay

CG samples carry Unix timestamps. `beta_eff_temporal(now)` weights each sample by `exp(−(now − t) / CG_HALFLIFE_SECS)` with `CG_HALFLIFE_SECS = 604_800` (7 days, Ebbinghaus-style). As samples age, β_eff drifts toward the conservative ceiling β₀ — older calibration data deflates without explicit recalibration.

### 2.5 Calibration

The harness runs two phases:
- **Phase A** with 2 adapters → measures `z_2` (latency at N=2).
- **Phase B** with M adapters → measures `z_M`.

Analytical USL fit (M ≥ 3):

```
β₀ = (z_M − z_2 × (M − 1)) / ((M − 1)(M − 2))
α  = z_2 − 2β₀
```

When M < 3 the fit falls back to `cfg.calibration_default_alpha` and `cfg.calibration_default_beta`. Online β₀ is then tracked via `beta_from_token_spans` — an EMA over per-merge timing pulled from the live token stream.

---

## 3. Eigenvalue Calibration

Source: `crates/h2ai-types/src/sizing.rs::EigenCalibration`.

Two constructors, both producing the same output shape (`n_effective`, `h_diversity`, `eigenvalues`, `n_pruned`):

```rust
EigenCalibration::from_cg_matrix(sigma, delta)        // Hamming CG similarity matrix
EigenCalibration::from_cosine_matrix(k, delta)        // pre-normalised cosine kernel (trace = 1)
```

Both compute symmetric eigendecomposition, clamp negative eigenvalues to 0 (numerical noise), and return:

- `n_effective = (Σ λ)² / Σ λ²` — participation ratio.
- `h_diversity = −Σ p_i ln p_i / ln N` — normalised Shannon entropy of the eigenvalue spectrum.
- `n_pruned` — the smallest N where adding the next adapter raises N_eff by less than `delta` (default `cfg.eigen_n_eff_delta = 0.05`).
- `rho_eff(n) = 1 − N_eff / n` — derived effective correlation.

`from_cg_matrix` is invoked at calibration time to produce the diversity-prior structure stored in `CalibrationCompletedEvent.eigen`. `from_cosine_matrix` is invoked both at calibration time (for `n_eff_cosine_prior`) and at MAPE-K decision time (for `n_eff_cosine_actual` from the wave's raw outputs).

---

## 4. Multiplication Condition Gates

Source: `crates/h2ai-types/src/sizing.rs::MultiplicationConditionFailure`. Four failure modes:

1. **InsufficientCompetence** — `p_mean ≤ min_competence`. Adding more adapters makes the committee worse.
2. **InsufficientDecorrelation** — `rho_mean ≥ max_correlation`. Errors are correlated; CJT gain collapses.
3. **CommonGroundBelowFloor** — `cg_mean < θ_coord`. Adapters too epistemically distant; coordination cost exceeds diversity benefit.
4. **InsufficientPoolDiversity** — `n_eff_cosine_prior < 1.0 + diversity_threshold`. Pool is semantically near-degenerate.

The first three are checked at Phase 2.5 by `MultiplicationChecker::check`. The fourth is checked at Phase 2.6 by the engine directly when `cfg.diversity_threshold > 0`.

> **`diversity_threshold` is used in two independent gates with different semantics.** Do not tune them as if they were the same gate:
>
> - **Phase 2.6 floor gate (pre-wave, blocking):** `n_eff_cosine_prior < 1.0 + diversity_threshold` — pool must have at least this much semantic headroom before the task starts. Logic: additive floor on N_eff.
> - **MAPE-K ratio gate (post-ZeroSurvival, classifier):** `n_eff_cosine_actual > diversity_threshold × n_requested` — classifies whether a zero-survival wave was caused by correlated collapse or constrained exploration. Logic: multiplicative ratio of N_eff to requested count.
>
> The same config field is intentional — the intuition "how semantically distinct should my pool be?" governs both. But the numeric effect differs: raising `diversity_threshold` tightens both the pre-wave pool requirement and the MAPE-K sensitivity to mode collapse.

---

## 5. Condorcet Jury Theorem — quality with correlation

Source: `crates/h2ai-types/src/sizing.rs::condorcet_quality`. Combines Condorcet (1785), Nitzan & Paroush (1982), and Ladha (1992):

```
Q_ind(N, p) = Σ_{k > N/2} C(N, k) p^k (1 − p)^(N − k)
              + (if N even) 0.5 × C(N, N/2) × p^(N/2) × (1 − p)^(N/2)

Q(N, p, ρ)  = p + (Q_ind(N, p) − p) × (1 − ρ)
```

Boundary cases enforced in code: `N = 1 → Q = p`, `ρ = 1 → Q = p`, `p ≤ 0 → Q = 0`, `p ≥ 1 → Q = 1`.

`EnsembleCalibration::from_cg_mean` derives p and ρ from CG_mean using two proxies:

```
p_mean   = 0.5 + CG_mean / 2
rho_mean = 1 − CG_mean
```

> **Proxy status (unvalidated conventions):** Both formulas are operational conventions without derivation.
>
> `p_mean = 0.5 + CG_mean / 2` assumes CG_mean is a linear proxy for individual agent accuracy
> (CG=0 → p=0.5, CG=1 → p=1.0). The oracle accumulator already measures the empirical p
> (oracle pass rate). When `oracle_calibration_basis >= 1` (≥10 observations), `from_measured_p`
> is the correct path and should be called automatically — this promotion is not yet implemented.
>
> `rho_mean = 1 − CG_mean` assumes low constraint agreement implies high error correlation. The
> direction is contested. It is replaced by the online ρ_EMA from verification score Pearson
> correlation once 30 task observations exist — this replacement is not yet implemented.

`EnsembleCalibration::from_measured_p` accepts a directly measured baseline accuracy (from the
oracle accumulator or from `compare.py`) and switches `prediction_basis` from `Heuristic` to
`Empirical`. This path should be triggered automatically from the oracle accumulator rather than
requiring manual operator intervention.

`n_optimal` is the N that maximises `(Q(N, p, ρ) − p) / N` — the marginal Condorcet gain per
adapter — capped at `max_n` (default 9 in production config).

### 5.1 Information-theoretic ceiling (primary quality target)

Source: `n_it_optimal(rho)`. Returns the smallest N where `(1 − ρ)^(N−1) < 0.5`, i.e. where the
marginal information gain drops below half the per-adapter entropy:

```
N_IT = ceil(log(0.5) / log(1 − ρ))    [information-theoretic optimal N]
```

Derivation: marginal information contribution of agent k is `I_k = H(X) × (1−ρ)^(k−1)`. N_IT
is where this drops below H(X)/2, after which adding agents yields diminishing returns regardless
of cost. This derivation is self-contained and does not require the USL domain-transfer assumption.

Matches `condorcet_n_optimal` within ±1 for ρ ∈ [0.3, 0.95]. **This is the primary quality
target; N_max_USL is the cost ceiling.** Planning logic: `min(N_IT, N_max_USL)`.

### 5.2 Physical enforcement of the independence requirement

The CJT independence requirement is not just a mathematical axiom — it is a physical constraint that the system actively enforces at three layers:

**Shared state isolation.** `WasmExecutor` runs scripts in a `wasmtime` sandbox with no WASI imports: no filesystem, no network, no host mutation. An agent cannot contaminate another agent's state space via code execution. `McpExecutor` enforces read-only access (`read_file`, `list_directory` only) at the executor layer regardless of backend capability. Agents that read the same resource get the same content and diverge only through their own reasoning — the intended source of independent diversity.

**Affinity bias elimination — two layers:**

- *Hard gate:* `VerifierExplorerFamilyConflict` fires before the MAPE-K loop when the explorer pool and the verification adapter share a provider family and `cfg.safety.family_constraint = RequireDiverse`. Not retryable — a topology problem, not a task problem.
- *Multi-variant judge panel:* Phase 3.5 runs `JudgePanel` with all available adapter families in parallel per constraint. Aggregation uses two rules depending on panel composition: `CrossFamily` → supermajority vote (`votes_pass ≥ ⌈N × quorum_fraction⌉` → Pass; `votes_fail ≥ quorum` → Fail; otherwise → Uncertain); `PersonaOnly` → unanimous (any split → Uncertain). The Uncertain path applies a score penalty (`uncertainty_weight`) rather than pruning — the constraint corpus binary-rubric decomposition is the primary debiasing layer per Prosa (2605.01630). CARE (2603.00039) shows that majority vote amplifies correlated error when judges share latent confounders; the PersonaOnly unanimous rule is derived from this finding.

**Serial fraction protection.** The TaoAgent TAO loop runs entirely inside the edge agent binary. No tool call crosses the NATS boundary during generation. α captures only the genuinely serial phases: constraint compilation, topology provisioning, and merge. The tool-call loop itself is fully parallel across N agents and contributes zero to α. This directly protects N_max from being driven toward 1 by accumulated NATS round-trip latency.

### 5.3 Honest limitation

The CJT is a theorem about **independent voters**. The system uses `(1 − ρ)` as a correction term. The ρ estimate starts as a proxy (`1 − CG_mean`) and upgrades to an empirical EMA once 30 task observations accumulate: `RhoEmaState` in `h2ai-api/src/rho_ema.rs` tracks per-adapter-pair Pearson score products and sets `prediction_basis = Empirical` on the `EnsembleCalibration`. Similarly, p_mean upgrades from `0.5 + CG_mean / 2` to oracle pass rate once 10 observations exist. Physical enforcement (§5.2) reduces the contamination surface but cannot eliminate shared pre-training data as a source of correlated failure.

---

## 6. MAPE-K Failure-Mode Classification

Source: `crates/h2ai-autonomic/src/epistemic.rs::classify_failure_mode`.

After a `ZeroSurvival` event, the engine computes `n_eff_cosine_actual` from the wave's raw outputs and classifies:

```
classify(n_eff, n_requested, diversity_threshold) =
    ConstrainedExploration   if n_eff > diversity_threshold × n_requested
    ModeCollapse             otherwise
```

The boundary depends on `diversity_threshold` (in `H2AIConfig`). At 0.0 the boundary is also 0.0 — every positive N_eff classifies as `ConstrainedExploration`. Production deployments set it to a meaningful value (e.g. 0.5).

Per-mode planner action:

| FailureMode | Diagnosis | Retry action |
|---|---|---|
| `ConstrainedExploration` | Diverse generation (high N_eff), but no proposal satisfied constraints. | Synthesise a Constraint Violation Tombstone — IDs and severity labels only — and pin it onto the next `TopologyProvisioned`. Topology unchanged. |
| `ModeCollapse` | Pool-correlated hallucination (low N_eff). | Increment `adapter_rotation_offset` modulo pool size; the next wave samples a rotated subset. |

Both are bookkept on Prometheus counter `h2ai_mapek_interventions_total{failure_mode="..."}`.

### 6.1 Tombstone synthesis

`synthesize_tombstone(violations: &[ConstraintViolation])` produces a single dense string containing each violated `constraint_id`, `severity_label`, and `score`. It deliberately does *not* include raw proposal text or remediation hints — the tombstone keeps context fill α low and avoids "Lost in the Middle" attention degradation on retries.

---

## 7. Epistemic Yield

Source: `crates/h2ai-types/src/events.rs::EpistemicYieldEvent`.

After `MergeResolved`, the engine spawns an async task that publishes:

```
yield_ratio = n_eff_cosine_actual / N_requested
```

The denominator is `N_requested`, not `N_responded`. The framing is financial: the operator pays for N adapters and receives `n_eff_actual` independent perspectives. A yield ratio below 1.0 means some of the requested adapters either failed or contributed redundant output. Below 0.5 indicates persistent semantic redundancy and is grounds for adapter pool review.

This event never blocks task close. It is an observability signal, not a control signal.

---

## 8. Ensemble Efficiency Index (j_eff)

Source: `h2ai-api/src/routes/tasks.rs::compute_j_eff`. Emitted as `j_eff: Option<f64>` on every `MergeResolvedEvent`.

```
j_eff = Q_realized / Q_ceiling

Q_realized = condorcet_quality(n_valid, filter_ratio, rho_mean)
Q_ceiling  = condorcet_quality(n_agents, p_mean, 0.0)

where filter_ratio = n_valid / n_agents
```

`Q_ceiling` is the theoretical quality bound for N agents at the calibrated p_mean with zero correlation — the best the committee could achieve. `Q_realized` is the quality bound actually achieved by the n_valid proposals that passed verification. The ratio measures what fraction of the theoretical ceiling the ensemble realised.

Interpretation:
- **j_eff ≈ 1.0** — the filter removed few proposals and ensemble diversity was well-used.
- **j_eff ≈ 0** — either very few proposals survived (low n_valid) or high correlation eroded the quality gain (`rho_mean ≈ 1`).
- **j_eff = None** — Q_ceiling ≤ 0 (degenerate calibration: p_mean = 0, n_agents = 0).

**Dynamic threshold:** The MAPE-K gate uses `j_eff_min = pareto_weights.diversity × thinking_coverage_score`. When the thinking loop is disabled or produces zero coverage, `thinking_coverage_score = 0.0` and the gate is inactive. When the thinking loop runs to completion (`coverage_score ≥ coverage_threshold`), the gate tightens proportionally to the diversity weight.

---

## 9. Merge Strategy Selection

Source: `crates/h2ai-types/src/sizing.rs::MergeStrategy::from_role_costs`.

A three-tier ladder driven by the maximum role error cost `c_i` across surviving proposals:

```
max_ci = max(role_error_costs)

if krum_f > 0 AND max_ci > krum_threshold     → OutlierResistant { f: krum_f }
elif max_ci > bft_threshold                   → ConsensusMedian
else                                          → ScoreOrdered
```

- `ScoreOrdered` — pick the highest verification score (cheapest, no Byzantine resistance).
- `ConsensusMedian` — pick the proposal with highest mean Jaccard similarity to the rest. Honest limitation: not Byzantine-resistant; vulnerable at f ≥ n/2.
- `OutlierResistant{f}` — Krum (Blanchard et al. 2017): pick the proposal with smallest sum of distances to its `n − f − 2` nearest neighbours in Jaccard-distance space. Quorum requirement: `n ≥ 2f + 3`.
- `MultiOutlierResistant{f, m}` — apply OutlierResistant iteratively to keep m survivors, then take the highest verification score.

**On the term "Byzantine" here.** The `OutlierResistant` algorithm is drawn from *federated learning Byzantine-robust aggregation* (Blanchard et al. 2017; Pillutla et al. 2019), not from PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance for distributed ledgers). In the federated learning literature, a "Byzantine fault" means any gradient that is a statistical outlier in the aggregation — not a cryptographically adversarial actor. LLM hallucinations that cluster in embedding space are precisely this kind of fault: they are outliers relative to the correct-answer distribution, not malicious agents subverting a protocol. The algorithm's breakdown-point proof (tolerating up to `f` outlier workers among `n ≥ 2f + 3`) applies to this statistical framing. The `bft_threshold` config key is shorthand for "fractional agreement gate" — it is not a reference to PBFT and implies no cryptographic guarantees.

---

## 10. Correlated Fabrication Index (SRANI)

Source: `crates/h2ai-orchestrator/src/srani_gate.rs`, `crates/h2ai-orchestrator/src/srani_grounding.rs`.

SRANI (Specification-Relative Architectural Noun Intersection) measures entity-level cross-proposal fabrication — distinct from the token-level Jaccard CV in §6.

### 9.1 CFI — Correlated Fabrication Index

For each proposal `i`, extract the set of architectural noun entities `E_i` that appear in the proposal but are absent from the task specification. The Correlated Fabrication Index is:

```
ungrounded_i = E_i \ spec_entities
CFI = max_{i ≠ j} |ungrounded_i ∩ ungrounded_j| / max(|ungrounded_i|, |ungrounded_j|)
```

CFI ∈ [0, 1]. CFI = 0 means no two proposals share any fabricated entity. CFI = 1 means at least one pair of proposals shares all fabricated entities — strong cross-proposal correlated fabrication signal.

### 9.2 Adaptive sigmoid gate

Rather than static thresholds, injection pressure is computed as:

```
injection_pressure = σ((CFI − μ) / T)
σ(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(−x))
```

- `μ` — EMA of observed CFI values: `μ_new = (1 − α) × μ_old + α × CFI`, `α = srani.ema_alpha` (default 0.20)
- `T` — sigmoid temperature (`srani.temperature`, default 0.15): lower = sharper cliff around μ
- Cold start: `μ = 0.45` until count ≥ 5 observations

When `injection_pressure ≥ srani.gate_threshold` (default 0.50), `SraniGroundingChain::resolve` is called.

### 9.3 EMA properties

The EMA tracks the system's operating CFI regime. With α = 0.20, the effective memory horizon is approximately 5 tasks (`1/α`). Tasks in a low-CFI regime build a low baseline, so genuine spikes trigger grounding. Tasks in a sustained high-CFI regime raise the baseline, preventing every wave from triggering.

Persistence: μ and count are written to NATS KV bucket `H2AI_ESTIMATOR` key `"srani_adaptive_state"` after each task and loaded at startup. This prevents cold-start reset across process restarts.

---

## 11. Attribution

Source: `crates/h2ai-orchestrator/src/attribution.rs::HarnessAttribution::compute`.

Per-task confidence decomposition (`q_confidence` — self-assessment, not oracle quality):

```
q_confidence = base_quality
             × verification_filter_ratio
             × tao_uplift_factor
             × topology_correction(rho_eff)
             + synthesis_gain
```

- `base_quality` — `Q(N, p, ρ)` from the calibrated CJT chain.
- `verification_filter_ratio` — fraction of proposals that survived Phase 3.5 + Phase 4.
- `tao_uplift_factor` — derived from the live `TaoMultiplierEstimator`, which is updated each task with turn-1 score vs. final score pairs.
- `topology_correction(rho_eff)` — soft penalty when the eigen-derived ρ exceeds the calibrated `rho_mean`.
- `synthesis_gain` — `Q(synthesis) − max(Q(individuals))` when Phase 5a runs; 0 otherwise.

Bootstrap intervals over CG samples (`bootstrap_interval`, 1000 resamples) provide `q_interval_lo` / `q_interval_hi` whenever ≥ 2 CG samples are available. The Talagrand rank histogram (`TalagrandDiagnostic::from_verification_scores`) supplies a calibration state used as a soft ρ correction in `S7`.

---

## 12. Honest Limitations

The math used in this system is calibrated to specific assumptions. They are listed here so they are not forgotten:

- **CJT independence.** The theorem assumes independent voters. The runtime corrects with `(1 − ρ)`, but ρ is proxied — not directly measured. Cross-family pools, single-family warnings, and the cosine N_eff guard mitigate this; they do not eliminate it.
- **CG as a proxy chain.** The flow is `CG → β_eff → N_max` and `CG → (p, ρ) → Q`. Each arrow is a heuristic. Empirical validation upgrades `p` to measured; ρ remains a proxy.
- **Correlated hallucination.** When two adapters share a training corpus and produce the same wrong answer, both Hamming CG and cosine N_eff can simultaneously read "high diversity" if the binary profiles disagree on different constraints. Phase 2.6 (cosine N_eff diversity guard), Phase 3.1 (token-Jaccard CV joint check), and Phase 3.2 (SRANI entity-level CFI with sigmoid-gated grounding) each add a layer of mitigation. None can eliminate shared pre-training data as a source of correlated failure — they reduce the surface, not eliminate it.
- **Synthesis gain is local.** `synthesis_gain` is measured against the same verification adapter that scored the individual proposals. A verifier blind spot inflates both terms equally and cancels out.
- **No oracle.** Without a `q_measured` from an external oracle, `q_confidence` is the only quality signal and it measures the system's self-confidence, not correctness. The bootstrap interval reflects CG variance, not ground-truth uncertainty.

## 13. Epistemic Leader

The Epistemic Leader subsystem runs inside the thinking loop. At the start of each wave it selects a leader adapter, generates a Socratic question intended to surface the most information about the violated constraints, distributes the remaining constraint dimensions to follower adapters, and rotates leadership when the current leader stagnates.

### 13.1 Expected Information Gain (EIG)

The heuristic EIG score for a candidate Socratic question `q` given violated constraint set `C` and belief buffer `B`:

```
EIG(q, C, B) = 0                                                      if fnv1a(q) ∈ {fnv1a(b.question) : b ∈ B}
EIG(q, C, B) = |{c ∈ C : c ∈ q}| + 0.5·(1 − sim(q, B))              otherwise

where sim(q, B) = |{b ∈ B : overlap(q, b.question) > 3 tokens}| / |B|
```

The argmax over `N` candidates is the selected question:

```
q* = argmax_{q₁…qₙ} EIG(qᵢ, C, B)
```

The first term rewards coverage: questions that reference more violated constraints score higher. The second term rewards novelty: `sim(q, B)` is the fraction of buffered past questions that overlap `q` by more than 3 tokens, so `1 − sim` is the per-candidate diversity score, weighted at 0.5.

The zero case short-circuits duplicate questions via an FNV-1a content hash so the same surface-form question is never asked twice within a session.

Phase 1 uses a token-overlap proxy for information-theoretic diversity. Phase 2 path: replace with embedding cosine distance for more principled diversity measurement.

### 13.2 SPRT-inspired rotation criterion

Leadership rotation fires when confidence improvement stagnates for `leader_stagnation_waves` consecutive waves:

```
rotate ← stagnation_count ≥ leader_stagnation_waves
          AND |confidence_history| ≥ 2
          AND confidence_history[-1] − confidence_history[-2] < leader_stagnation_threshold
```

This approximates a Sequential Probability Ratio Test stopping criterion: the null hypothesis (leader is improving) is rejected when the most recent Δ`q_confidence` falls below the minimum detectable effect `leader_stagnation_threshold`. Once rotation fires, the next adapter in the round-robin pool is promoted and `stagnation_count` resets to zero.

### 13.3 Credibility update

Leader credibility is a scalar in [0, 1] updated at each wave:

```
credibility_{t+1} = clamp(credibility_t + rate · improved_t, 0, 1)

where improved_t = (q_confidence_t − q_confidence_{t-1}) ≥ leader_stagnation_threshold
      rate = +leader_credibility_decay_rate   if improved_t
           = −leader_credibility_decay_rate   otherwise
```

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `credibility_t` | Scalar credibility of the current leader before wave `t` |
| `improved_t` | Boolean: confidence improved by at least the stagnation threshold |
| `leader_credibility_decay_rate` | Step size for credibility updates (config) |
| `leader_credibility_warn_threshold` | Floor below which followers receive a low-confidence prefix (config) |

When `credibility < leader_credibility_warn_threshold`, follower context is prefixed with a low-confidence warning, preventing followers from over-anchoring on a stale leader signal.

### 13.4 Follower aspect assignment

Violated constraint IDs are distributed to `N_follower` follower slots round-robin:

```
aspect(i) = violated_constraints[i mod |violated_constraints|]
```

This enforces Tree-of-Thoughts-style forced diversity: each follower explores a different constraint dimension in the same wave, preventing mode collapse to a single repair strategy. When `|violated_constraints| < N_follower`, constraint IDs wrap around so every follower still receives an assigned dimension.
